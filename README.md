# Blister
A simple dropbox/Google Drive like app that can be self hosted on AWS


## Rationale & Wishlist

I want to build this app because it's a great learning experience to attack three verticals

1. Production python application
2. Tightly controlled AWS infrastructure
3. Relevant desktop client for sync built in rust possibly

I want Blister to be fast & intuitive

1. A react frontend makes sense
2. HTTP uploads should be taken care of by Django
3. Speed is of the essence for large files so a well developed fast and secure upload/download


This will allow me to use AWS and experiment with CDK, something I've had my eye on for a while.
